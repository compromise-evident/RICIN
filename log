Version 3       Acquiring new headphones (at least the ones mentioned in src) is
                surely the reproducible part,  but I may need to better describe
                the microphone? It came from a small curved  cone-like  covering
                with padding on the bottom to put on a table.  Optomizations are
                safe and probably not so dependent on headphone diaphragm weight
                or whether or not you're using coil/cap microphones.  We'll see.
